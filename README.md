## 42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot
### Preface:
- This is a guide to the Born2beRoot project, and it was written using resources from several other guides, therefore the credit is to them.
- The purpose of re-writing this updated guide is to edit some errors that I've come across using some of the guides, and to help prevent issues that I've had to truobleshoot.
- Debian is the chosen Operating System for this project.
- The Mandatory part of the subject.pdf involves using the Guided Partitioning Method of the Debian installation. The Bonus part of the subject.pdf involves using the Manual Partitioning Method. This guide has instructions for the Manual Partitioning Method, which I recommend you do from the start, thus passing you both the Mandatory part, and 1/3 of the Bonus part of Born2beRoot.
