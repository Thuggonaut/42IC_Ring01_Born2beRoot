# 42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot
### Preface:
- This is a guide to the Born2beRoot project, and it was written using resources from several other guides, therefore the credit is to them.
- The purpose of re-writing this updated guide is to edit some errors that I've come across using some of the guides, and to help prevent issues that I've had to troubleshoot.
- Debian is the chosen Operating System for this project.
- The Mandatory part of the subject.pdf involves using the Guided Partitioning Method of the Debian installation. The Bonus part of the subject.pdf involves using the Manual Partitioning Method. This guide has instructions for the Manual Partitioning Method, which I recommend you do from the start, thus passing you both the Mandatory part, and 1/3 of the Bonus part of Born2beRoot.

## Step 1: Download the Debian installer for your Virtual Machine (VM)
### 1.1: Debian
1. [Click here to download Debian GNU/Linux](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `debian-mac-xx.x.x-amd64-netinst.iso`

### 1.2: VM Directory (For 42Adelaide Students)**
1. In iTerm2:
- `cd sgoinfre/students`
- `mkdir <your_intra_usename>`
- `chmod 700 <your_intra_usename>`
2. Find your Debian download from Step 1.1 and put that download in this `sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_usename>` directory that you have just created (in iTerm2, `open .` to open/find the directory, and drag/drop your Debian download in there). 

### 1.3: Virtual Box
1. Open the Virtual Box application

## Step 2: Installing your VM
1. Select `New`
