# üñ•Ô∏è 42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot
## Preface:
   - This is a guide to the Born2beRoot project, and it was written using resources from several other guides, therefore the credit is to them.
   - The purpose of re-writing this updated guide is to edit some errors that I've come across using some of the guides, and to help prevent issues that I've had to troubleshoot.
   - Debian is the chosen Operating System for this project.
   - The Mandatory part of the subject.pdf involves using the Guided Partitioning Method of the Debian installation. The Bonus part of the subject.pdf involves using the Manual Partitioning Method. This guide has instructions for the Manual Partitioning Method, which I recommend you do from the start, thus passing you both the Mandatory part, and 1/3 of the Bonus part of Born2beRoot.

## üî∑ Step 4: Starting & setting up your VM
   
### üî∏ 4.1: Starting up your VM
1. At every start up, use your encryption password.
2. You can either:
    - Login as `root` or
    - Login as `<your_intra_username>`, then later use `su -` to log in as root if required.

### üî∏ 4.2: Installing Sudo
1. Ensure you are logged in as root: `su -`
2. `apt-get update -y`
3. `apt-get upgrade -y`
4. `apt install sudo`
5. `sudo usermod -aG sudo <your_intra_username>` to add user in the group 'sudo'.
6. `getent group sudo` to check if user is in sudo group.
7. `sudo visudo` to open the sudoers file.
8. Find the line: # User privilege specification. Underneath that line, type `<your_intra_username>  	ALL=(ALL) ALL`

### üî∏ 4.3: Installing Git
1. `sudo apt-get install git -y`

### üî∏ 4.4: Installing Vim
1. `sudo apt-get install vim -y`

### üî∏ 4.5: Installing & Configuring SSH (Secure Shell Host)
1. `sudo apt install openssh-server`
2. `sudo systemctl status ssh` to check SSH Server Status.
3. `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
4. Find the line #Port22. Edit it to `Port 4242` without the '#' in front of it.
5: Save and Exit Vim. (_Use `:q` then follow the prompts to save. '^' means `<Ctrl>`_).
6. `sudo service ssh restart` to restart the SSH Service.
   
### üî∏ 4.6: Installing & Configuring UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
1. `sudo apt-get install ufw` to install UFW.
2. `sudo ufw enable` to enable UFW.
3. `sudo ufw status numbered` to check the status of UFW.
4. `sudo ufw allow ssh` to configure the Rules.
5. `sudo ufw allow 4242` to configure the Port Rules.
6. `sudo ufw status numbered` to check the status of UFW 4242 Port.
   
## üî∑ Step 5: Connecting to SSH
Note: press `<command>` on your Apple Keyboard & your mouse should re-appear
1. Go to your Virtual Box Program.
2. Click on your Virtual Machine and go to `Settings`
    - Go to `Network`
    - Select `Adapter 1`
    - Select `Advanced`
    - Click on `Port Forwarding`
    - Change the Host Port & Guest Port to `4242`:
         - Name: Rule 1
         - Protocol: TCP
         - Host IP: (_blank_)
         - Host Port: 4224
         - Guest IP: (_blank_)
         - Guest Port: 4242
    - `Ok`
3. Go back to your Virtual Machine.
4. `sudo systemctl restart ssh` to restart your SSH Server.
5. `sudo service sshd status` to check your SSH Status.
6. Open an iTerm & type `ssh <your_intra_username>@127.0.0.1 -p 4242`
    - Note: In case an error occurs, type `rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts` in your iTerm & then retype `ssh <your_intra_username>@127.0.0.1 -p 4242`
7. Type `exit` to quit your SSH iTerm Connection.

    - The line should now look like this: `password  requisite     pam_pwquality.so  retry=3 minlen=10 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root`
4. Save and Exit Vim
5. `sudo vim /etc/login.defs` to configure the Password Policy.

1. `cd ~/../`
2. `cd var/log`
3. `mkdir sudo` 
4. `cd sudo`
5. `touch sudo.log`
6. `cd ~/../`

### üî∏ 8.2: Configuring the Sudoers Group
1. `sudo visudo` to open to Sudoers file.
2. Edit your sudoers file by adding the rest of the defaults so it should read like this:
   `Defaults	env_reset
Defaults	mail_badpass
Defaults	secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
Defaults	badpass_message="Password is wrong, please try again!"
Defaults	passwd_tries=3
Defaults	logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
Defaults	log_input, log_output
Defaults	requiretty`
