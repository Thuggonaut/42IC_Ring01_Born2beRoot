# üñ•Ô∏è 42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot
## Preface:
   - This is a guide to the Born2beRoot project, & was written using resources from several other guides, therefore the credit is to them.
   - The purpose of re-writing this updated guide is to edit some discrepencies that I've come across using some of the guides, & help prevent issues that I've had to troubleshoot.
   - Debian is the chosen Operating System for this project.
   - The Mandatory part of the subject.pdf involves using the Guided Partitioning Method of the Debian installation. The Bonus part of the subject.pdf involves using the Manual Partitioning Method. This guide has instructions for the Manual Partitioning Method, which I recommend you do from the start, thus passing you both the Mandatory part, and 1/3 of the Bonus part of Born2beRoot.

    - Login as `root` or
    - Login as `<your_intra_username>`, then later use `su -` to log in as root if required.

### üî∏ 4.2: Installing Sudo
1. Ensure you are logged in as root: `su -`
2. `apt-get update -y`
3. `apt-get upgrade -y`
4. `apt install sudo`
5. `sudo usermod -aG sudo <your_intra_username>` to add user in the group 'sudo'.
6. `getent group sudo` to check if user is in sudo group.

## üî∑ Step 10: Self-evaluation Checklist & Testing
Note: I recommend going through the checklist yourself to ensure everything works as it should, before retrieving the signature of your machines virtual disk.

### üî∏ 10.1: Preliminary tests (for your peer evaluation)
- [ ] Git repository is sucessfully cloned.
- [ ] The Git repository contains a signature.txt file.
- [ ] `cat signature.txt` then 
	`cd/sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_username>/<your_VM_name>` then
	`cd <your_VM_name>` then
	`shasum <your_VM_name>.vdi`
	The signature.txt against the students ‚Äú.vdi‚Äù file is identical. 
- [ ] Clone the VM then start it up. 


### üî∏ 10.2: General VM Setup
- [ ] `sudo ufw status` checks UFW service is started. Look for `status: active`
- [ ] `sudo systemctl status ssh` checks SSH service is started.
- [ ] `lsb_release -a || cat /etc/os-release` checks the chosen operating system (Debian or Rocky).


### üî∏ 10.3: Mandatory Part (for your peer evaluation)
- [ ] During the defense, a script must display all information every 10 minutes.

### üî∏ 10.4: Users & groups
- [ ] `getent group sudo` the students intra username must be present in the group `sudo`.
- [ ] `getent group user42` the students intra username must be present in the group `user42`.
- [ ] `sudo adduser <new_user>` evaluator to create a new user e.g. testuser.
- [ ] `sudo groupadd <groupname>` evaluator to create a new group e.g. testgroup.
- [ ] `sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>` evaluator to add the new user to the new group.
- [ ] `groups <username>` checks the group the user belongs to.


### üî∏ 10.5: Password policy
- [ ] `sudo chage -l <username>` checks the newly created user password follows the required policy (30 days max, 2 days min, 7 days warning).
- [ ] [How do you implement the password policy?](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot/blob/main/README.md#to-set-up-the-password-policy)

### üî∏ 10.6: Hostname and partitions
- [ ] `hostnamectl` checks the hostname of the machine is correctly formatted as follows: `<student_login>42`
- [ ] `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>` evaluator to modify the hostname by replacing the login with theirs. Then, `sudo reboot` to restart the VM.
- [ ] On restart, if the hostname has not been updated, the evaluation stops here. Otherwise, the student logs back in (not the evaluator).
- [ ] `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>` to restore the VM to the original hostname. Then, `sudo reboot` to restart the VM.
- [ ] `lsblk` to view the VM's partitions. Compare the output with the example given in the subject.pdf.

	
### üî∏ 10.7: Sudo
- [ ] `sudo visudo` the student shows how to access the sudoers file.	
- [ ] [What is the sudoers file, & its purpose?](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot/blob/main/README.md#the-sudoers-file)
- [ ] `cd /var/log/sudo` verify the ‚Äú/var/log/sudo/‚Äù directory exists.
- [ ] `ls` should show sudo.log file exists. 
- [ ] `cat sudo.log` should display a history of the sudo command executions.
- [ ] Run any command using `sudo`. Check if the sudo.log file in the ‚Äú/var/log/sudo/‚Äù directory have been updated.


### üî∏ 10.8: UFW
- [ ] `sudo ufw status numbered` Lists the active rules in UFW. A rule must exist for port 4242.
- [ ] `sudo ufw allow 8080` Adds a new rule to open port 8080. `sudo ufw status numbered` to check that this rule has been added by listing the active rules.
- [ ] Delete this new rule with the help of the student.
	`sudo ufw delete 6`
	`sudo ufw delete 3`
	

### üî∏ 10.9: SSH
- [ ] `sudo service ssh status` checks if its active & uses port 4242.
- [ ] In an iterm2, `ssh <new_user>@127.0.0.1 -p 4242` evaluator to connect to SSH with their username. If connection successful, `exit` to exit the connection. 
- [ ] `ssh <your_intra_username42>@127.0.0.1 -p 4242` checks that the root user cannot connect to SSH. An error message "permission denied" should be displayed.

	
### üî∏ 10.10: Script Monitoring
- [ ] [What is the `monitoring.sh script`?](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot/blob/main/README.md#the-monitoringsh-script)
- [ ] [What is the `wall` command?](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot/blob/main/README.md#the-wall-command)
- [ ] Ask to see the student's code for the script. `cd /usr/local/bin` then, `vim monitoring.sh`
- [ ] [What is Cron & its purpose?](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot/blob/main/README.md#cron)
- [ ] `sudo crontab -u root -e` (change the `10` value to `1`)
- [ ] The student being evaluated should make the script stop or start running without modifying the script itself. To check this, `sudo reboot` to restart the VM.
	- `sudo /etc/init.d/cron stop`	
	- `sudo /etc/init.d/cron start`


## üî∑ Step 11: Retrieve the Signature of your machine‚Äôs virtual disk 
1. `log out` & `Power off` your machine to close your VM. ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT RETRIEVE YOUR DISK'S SIGNATURE WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS STEP!‚ö†Ô∏è
2. In iTerm2, `cd /sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_username>/<your_VM_name>` to go into the directory where your .vdi file is.
2. `ls` to view the .vdi file.
3. `shasum <your_VM_name>.vdi` to retrieve your VM's disk signature. (This can take up to several minutes.)
4. Copy and paste this into a `signature.txt` file at the root of your Git repository. 
5. Clone your VM from VirtualBox.
5. Repeat steps 2 - 3 to ensure your `signature.txt` is identical to your `<your_VM_name>.vdi` before pushing for evaluation. 

Note: Ensure your evaluator starts your VM Clone for evaluation to prevent your disk's signature from changing for the next evaluation. 


## üî∑ Step 12: Evaluation Answers
#### A Virtual Machine (VM)
- is like a computer within a computer.
- a software based emulation of a physical computer system.
- a VM is an isolated environment, seperate from your main computer system. Here, you can run different operating systems, software, applications, experiments, and tests without affecting your main computer.
- a VM works by mimicking the hardware componenets of a physical computer: CPU, RAM, storage, and network interfaces, creating a virtualised environment that behaves like a physical computer.

#### The differences between Rocky and Debian
- Debian has a community driven development model and a large community of contributers and users. Debian aims to be a universal Operating System, suitable for a wide range of use cases including desktop systems and personal servers. It adheres to the Free Software Principles (FSP): freedom to run, study, modify, and distribute software. 
- Rocky is led by the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation that oversees the development and distribution of Rocky Linux. Rocky provides an enterprise-grade linux that serves as a drop-in replacement for CentOS. It is designed, developed and tested to meet the demands of larger scale businesses and organisations. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### The subject.pdf reccommends Debian
- for beginners in system administration, as setting up Rocky is more complex.
- Debian is user-friendly.
- Debian being older than Rockey, has a larger, active community of users and developers which means there is access to extensive documentation and resources for troubleshooting. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### The difference between aptitude and apt 
- aptitude more advanced and interactive, while apt is simpler and more straightforward.
- the main difference between aptitude and apt is how they handle package dependencies (other software needed for a program to work). aptitude is smarter at resolving complex dependencies and finding the best solution. It can suggest alternative options if there are conflicts between packages. apt, on the other hand, is simpler and more straightforward in resolving dependencies.
- Another difference is how you use them. apt has shorter and easier-to-remember commands, like `apt update` or `apt install`, while aptitude uses slightly different commands like `aptitude update` or `aptitude install`.
- aptitude has a special text interface that lets you browse and search for packages interactively, while apt doesn't have that feature. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### AppArmor 
- provides an additional layer of defense by restricting an application's privileges and actions to only what is explicitly permitted by its security policy. 
- using AppArmor, system administrators and developers can enhance the security of their systems by limiting the potential impact of security breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive resources. It adds an extra layer of protection to help prevent applications from causing harm or accessing data they shouldn't have access to. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)

#### LVM 
- stands for Logical Volume Manager.
- it allows the manipulation of partitions or logical volume on a storage device. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### SSH
- stands for Secure Shell.
- an authentication mechanism between a client and a host.
- uses encryption techniques so that all communication between clients and hosts is done in encyypted form, preventing unauthorised access, protecting sensitive data. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### UFW 
- stands for Uncomplicated Firewall.
- an interface that modifies the firewall of a device without compromising security.
- used to configure which ports to allow connections, and which ports to close. 
- useful in conjunction with SSH. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### Short for "superuser do"
- `sudo` is a command used to execute other commands requiring higher priveledges and permissions. 
- allows a user with admin priveleges to temporarily gain "root" or superuser priveledges. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### To set up the password policy
- the command is `sudo vim /etc/login.defs`. Here we can adjust the frquency of:
	- the maximum number of days before a password expiry.
	- the minimum number of days allowed before the modification of a password.
	- the number of days before a user receives a warning message their password is to expire. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### The advantages of the password policy
- include increasing the security of the system.
- the disadvantages include the challenge of having to change passwords if frequent, and it can be difficult to create new and different passwords each time. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### The sudoers file 
- contains the configurations of user priveledges.
- using the command `sudo visudo` opens the sudoer's fie, and here, you can edit user priveledges. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### The monitoring.sh script 
- is used to monitor the performance and status of a server or system.
- it gathers data on system resource utilizaiton (e.g. CPU, memory, disk usage), network traffic and other metrics. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
	
#### The `wall` command
- is used to broadcast a message (i.e. the monitoring.sh script) to all users currently logged on to the system. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)

#### Cron 
- from the Greek word "chronos", means the measure of time.
- is a utility program that enables the scheduling of commands or scripts to run automatically at specified intervals. 
- crontab is the configuration file where you can specify the commands to run and when. 
- each asterisk *, accounts for: minute; hour; day; month; day of the week, in this order. [*Back to Evaluation Checklist*](https://github.com/Thuggonaut/42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot#-step-10-self-evaluation-checklist--testing)
