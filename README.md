# üñ•Ô∏è 42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot
## Preface:
   - This is a guide to the Born2beRoot project, & was written using resources from several other guides, therefore the credit is to them.
   - The purpose of re-writing this updated guide is to edit some errors that I've come across using some of the guides, & help prevent issues that I've had to troubleshoot.
   - Debian is the chosen Operating System for this project.
   - The Mandatory part of the subject.pdf involves using the Guided Partitioning Method of the Debian installation. The Bonus part of the subject.pdf involves using the Manual Partitioning Method. This guide has instructions for the Manual Partitioning Method, which I recommend you do from the start, thus passing you both the Mandatory part, and 1/3 of the Bonus part of Born2beRoot.

## üî∑ Step 10: Self-evaluation Checklist & Testing
Note: I recommend going through the checklist yourself to ensure everything works as it should, before retrieving the signature of your machines virtual disk.

### üî∏ 10.1: Preliminary tests (for your peer evaluation)
- [ ] Git repository is sucessfully cloned.
- [ ] The Git repository contains a signature.txt file.
- [ ] `cat signature.txt` then 
	`cd/sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_username>/<your_VM_name>` then
	`cd <your_VM_name>` then
	`shasum <your_VM_name>.vdi`
	The signature.txt against the students ‚Äú.vdi‚Äù file is identical. 
- [ ] Clone the VM then start it up. 


### üî∏ 10.2: General VM Setup
- [ ] `sudo ufw status` checks UFW service is started. Look for `status: active`
- [ ] `sudo systemctl status ssh` checks SSH service is started.
- [ ] `lsb_release -a || cat /etc/os-release` checks the chosen operating system (Debian or Rocky).


### üî∏ 10.3: Mandatory Part (for your peer evaluation)
- [ ] During the defense, a script must display all information every 10 minutes.
- [ ] What is a Virtual Machine, & how does it work?
- [ ] What are the differences between Rocky & Debian?
- [ ] What is your choice of operating system & why?
- [ ] For Debian: what are the difference between aptitude and apt? What is APPArmor?
- [ ] All explanations are satisfactory (or evaluation stops here).
- [ ] What is LVM & what does it do?
- [ ] What is SSH & the value of using it?
- [ ] What is UFW & the value of using it?
- [ ] What is sudo?

	
### üî∏ 10.4: Users & groups
- [ ] `getent group sudo` the students intra username must be present in the group `sudo`.
- [ ] `getent group user42` the students intra username must be present in the group `user42`.
- [ ] `sudo adduser <new_user>` evaluator to create a new user e.g. testuser.
- [ ] `sudo groupadd <groupname>` evaluator to create a new group e.g. testgroup.
- [ ] `sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>` evaluator to add the new user to the new group.
- [ ] `groups <username>` checks the group the user belongs to.


### üî∏ 10.5: Password policy
- [ ] `sudo chage -l <username>` checks the newly created user password follows the required policy (30 days max, 2 days min, 7 days warning).
- [ ] How do you implement the password policy?
- [ ] What are the advantages & disadvantages of the password policy?

	
### üî∏ 10.6: Hostname and partitions
- [ ] `hostnamectl` checks the hostname of the machine is correctly formatted as follows: `<student_login>42`
- [ ] `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>` evaluator to modify the hostname by replacing the login with theirs. Then, `sudo reboot` to restart the VM.
- [ ] On restart, if the hostname has not been updated, the evaluation stops here. Otherwise, the student logs back in (not the evaluator).
- [ ] `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>` to restore the VM to the original hostname. Then, `sudo reboot` to restart the VM.
- [ ] `lsblk` to view the VM's partitions. Compare the output with the example given in the subject.pdf.

	
### üî∏ 10.7: Sudo
- [ ] `sudo visudo` the student shows how to access the sudoers file.	
- [ ] What is the sudoers file, & its purpose? 
- [ ] `cd /var/log/sudo` verify the ‚Äú/var/log/sudo/‚Äù directory exists.
- [ ] `ls` should show sudo.log file exists. 
- [ ] `cat sudo.log` should display a history of the sudo command executions.
- [ ] Run any command using `sudo`. Check if the sudo.log file in the ‚Äú/var/log/sudo/‚Äù directory have been updated.


### üî∏ 10.8: UFW
- [ ] `sudo ufw status numbered` Lists the active rules in UFW. A rule must exist for port 4242.
- [ ] `sudo ufw allow 8080` Adds a new rule to open port 8080. `sudo ufw status numbered` to check that this rule has been added by listing the active rules.
- [ ] Delete this new rule with the help of the student.
	`sudo ufw delete 6`
	`sudo ufw delete 3`
	

### üî∏ 10.9: SSH
- [ ] `sudo service ssh status` checks if its active & uses port 4242.
- [ ] In an iterm2, `ssh <new_user>@127.0.0.1 -p 4242` evaluator to connect to SSH with their username. If connection successful, `exit` to exit the connection. 
- [ ] `ssh <your_intra_username42>@127.0.0.1 -p 4242` checks that the root user cannot connect to SSH. An error message "permission denied" should be displayed.

	
### üî∏ 10.10: Script Monitoring
- [ ] What is the `monitoring.sh script`?
- [ ] What is the `wall` command?
- [ ] Ask to see the student's code for the script. `cd /usr/local/bin` then, `vim monitoring.sh`
- [ ] What is Cron & its purpose?
- [ ] `sudo crontab -u root -e` (change the `10` value to `1`)
- [ ] The student being evaluated should make the script stop or start running without modifying the script itself. To check this, `sudo reboot` to restart the VM.
	- `sudo /etc/init.d/cron stop`	
	- `sudo /etc/init.d/cron start`


## üî∑ Step 11: Retrieve the Signature of your machine‚Äôs virtual disk 
1. `log out` & `Power off` your machine to close your VM. ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT RETRIEVE YOUR DISK'S SIGNATURE WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS STEP!‚ö†Ô∏è
2. In iTerm2, `cd /sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_username>/<your_VM_name>` to go into the directory where your .vdi file is.
2. `ls` to view the .vdi file.
3. `shasum <your_VM_name>.vdi` to retrieve your VM's disk signature. (This can take up to several minutes.)
4. Copy and paste this into a `signature.txt` file at the root of your Git repository. 
5. Clone your VM from VirtualBox.
5. Repeat steps 2 - 3 to ensure your `signature.txt` is identical to your `<your_VM_name>.vdi` before pushing for evaluation. 

Note: Ensure your evaluator starts your VM Clone for evaluation to prevent your disk's signature from changing for the next evaluation. 
	
# üòé Good luck!
