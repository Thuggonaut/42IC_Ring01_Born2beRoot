üñ•Ô∏è # 42_IC_Ring01_Born2beRoot
## Preface:
- This is a guide to the Born2beRoot project, and it was written using resources from several other guides, therefore the credit is to them.
- The purpose of re-writing this updated guide is to edit some errors that I've come across using some of the guides, and to help prevent issues that I've had to troubleshoot.
- Debian is the chosen Operating System for this project.
- The Mandatory part of the subject.pdf involves using the Guided Partitioning Method of the Debian installation. The Bonus part of the subject.pdf involves using the Manual Partitioning Method. This guide has instructions for the Manual Partitioning Method, which I recommend you do from the start, thus passing you both the Mandatory part, and 1/3 of the Bonus part of Born2beRoot.

## Step 1: Download the Debian installer for your Virtual Machine (VM)
### 1.1: Debian
1. [Click here to download Debian GNU/Linux](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `debian-mac-xx.x.x-amd64-netinst.iso`

### 1.2: VM Directory (For 42Adelaide Students)
1. In iTerm2:
- `cd sgoinfre/students`
- `mkdir <your_intra_usename>`
- `chmod 700 <your_intra_usename>`
2. Find your Debian download file from Step 1.1 and put that download in this `sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_usename>` directory that you have just created (_in iTerm2,_ `open .` _to open/find the directory, and drag/drop your Debian download file in there_). 

### 1.3: Virtual Box
1. Open the Virtual Box application

## Step 2: Installing your VM
1. Select `New`

2. Name and operating system:
- Name: e.g. `Born2beRoot`

- Type: `Linux `
- Version: `Debian (64-bit)`
- `Continue`

3. Memory Size:
- `1024`MB
- `Continue`

4. Hard disk:
- Select `Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now`
- `Create`

5. Hard disk file type:
- Select `VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)`
- `Continue`

6. Storage on physical hard disk:
- Select `Dyamically Allocated`
- `Continue`

7. File location and size:
- `12.00`GB
- `Create`

8. VM Storage:
- Go to `Settings`
- Select `Storage`
- Find "Optical Drive" under "Attributes" & click on the drop down menu. Select `Choose a disk file...`
- Select the Debian Download file (.iso) from your `/sgoinfre/students/<your_intra_usename>` directory. 
- `Open`
- `Ok`

## Step 3: Setting up your VM partitions
1. Go to `Start` (_The green arrow_)
Note: you will only be able to use your Keyboard to operate your Virtual Machine.
Note: to increase the size of your VM window, go to the menu bar and either:
- Select `Scaled Mode (Host+C)` then, with your mouse drag the VM window.
- Select `Virtual Screen 1` then, select `Scale to 200% (autoscaled output)`

2. Select `Install` (_Do not select "Graphical install"_).

3. Select a language: `English`

4. Select your location: `Australia`

5. Configure the keyboard: `American English`

6. Configure the network:
- Hostname: `<your_intra_username42>` (_ensure "42" is at the end_)
- Domain name: leave blank

7. Set up users and passwords:
- Root password: it is reccomended you use the same passwords for all passwords. Write it down should you forget it. 
- Full name for the new user: personally, I used `<your_intra_username>` without the "42". 
- Username for your account: `<your_intra_username>` without the "42". 
- Choose a password for the new user: use the same password as "Root password".

8. Partition disks:
- Select `Manual`
- Select `SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) 8.6 GB ATA VBOX HARDDISK`
- Create new empty partition table on this device?: `Yes`
- Select `pri/log 8.6 GB FREE SPACE`
- How to use this free space: `Create a new partition`
- New partition size: `500M`
- Type for the new partition: `Primary`
- Location for the new partition: `Beginning`
- Partition settings: `Mount point:     /`
- Mount point for this partition: `/boot - static files of the boot loader`

  - `[*] /dev/sda5` is selected 

- Select `Done setting up the partitions`
- Encryption configuration actions: `Finish`
- Really erase the data on SCSI1 (0,0,0), partition #5 (sda)?: `Yes`
